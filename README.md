All Questions and Answers in Syllabus of Statistical Inference - JHU Coursera

# Take Note: dd. 21-7-2016 these files were uploaded to be reviewed by an instructor. The answers here are my own - and might therefore be complete wrong! The exercises that have youtube and links attached are - for now - not included (well, I tried to hide them). In a more definite version they will be included. Perhaps even with my own interpretation of the correct answer added to it (ultimitely this has started for me to understand the theory). 

## remarks on the layout

### .HTML
.html should look good 
* after downloading and opening in a browser, not straight in Github

### .pdf
* Was made manually from .html in a browser, but the formulas are still a bitt messed up
* for some reason couldn't knit a pdf in RStudio.

### .Rmd / .md
* doesn't represent formulas correct. 
* And lettered list are converted to latin numbered list. 
* Makes the Answers a bit hard to match. 
* R code doesn't go really well either
* the exercises with answers are supposed to be hidden, not in the .Rmd view on Github

So: either way, it looks not like I would have it. But looking at time spent - and why (getting the right answers to un-answered exercises to better understand Statistical Inference), this will have to do. 

Promise to spent time on it - when requested - after I've completed the Data Science Specialization.
